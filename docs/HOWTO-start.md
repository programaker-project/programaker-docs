# Plaza project have 3 principal components:

- **Backend** : The internal Plaza core.
- **Frontend** : The web user access to interact with Plaza core data.
- **Bridges** : Something similar to "widgets" who can connect Plaza core with external internet resources.

## The basic diagram is:
👤 User ↔️ 💻 **Frontend** ↔️ ⚙️ **Backend** ↔️ 📡 **Bridges** ↔️ 📜 External services
    
### Backend

It's the piece that makes everything work (the core ⚙️).

Runs the programs you build, remembers the important stuff and interconnects the bridges.

The backend consists in a something similar to a  virtual machine, runs "low level code" and relies on bridges to connect with external services,
like Telegram©.

### Bridges

**Bridges** are small programs that connect the Plaza backend to any service.

This small programs can be built by anyone ( like a Firefox© addons ), they are run from outside the Plaza platform.

This programs are basic and intermediaries between the external services API's ( Like Telegram©, your favorite forecast platform, another external product... ) and the **Backend** **Plaza core ⚙️**.

Its principal function is to *"translate"* that *"📡 protocols"* to the internal **Plaza core ⚙️**.

### Frontend

The **frontend** ([https://projectplaza.space](https://projectplaza.space) ) is the project interface you can see through the browser, this makes Plaza cross-platform by default.

It takes information from the Plaza **Backend** and shows it visually.

Then the user can, through the **frontend**, send orders to the backend to modify this information.

It takes programs from the **Plaza Backend** and shows them visually.

Then the user through the **frontend**, can create, modify or delete these programs in the fronted editor.

This makes it possible for anyone to develop new applications.
